Really good start.

1. WHY does the flow increase toward the center of the boundary?

2.  I think that you interpreted these as heads, not flows?

3. Very minor point ... but the left half of the oval should be the boundary, right?

4. This one is tricky.  Near the well they SHOULD be circles ... why aren't they?
Farther from the well, you are right.  But, see if you can craft and explanation
that invokes both the constant head and no flow boundaries.

5. Good catch on the row indices!  The built-in flopy plotting routines make the
'flip' for you.  Just remember this if you decide to create your own plots!
